## 🚀 About The Project
VigorAI is a next-generation fitness architecture platform designed to replace generic workout trackers. It uses a **Cinematic UI**, **Simulated AI Neural Engine**, and **Computer Vision** concepts to generate hyper-personalized workout protocols and nutritional strategies.

Built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and **Framer Motion**, the application features a "Netflix-style" glassmorphism interface that feels native, fluid, and futuristic.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **🎥 Cinematic Authentication:** Split-screen login with 4K video backgrounds and a 2-step simulated security clearance flow (Email → OTP).
* **🧠 Dynamic Protocol Generation:** Generates 3 distinct training styles (Muscle Gain, Weight Loss, Strength) with specific exercises, reps, and sets.
* **📺 Interactive Video Coaching:** "Accordion-style" workout cards that expand to reveal embedded YouTube tutorials and technical cues.
* **👁️ AI Vision Scanner:** (Demo) Simulates analyzing food photos to automatically log calories and macros.
* **🎙️ Voice Command Log:** Integrated Speech-to-Text API to log meals via voice commands.
* **⚡ Zero-Latency Architecture:** Uses a "Stubbed Backend" strategy for demonstration reliability, ensuring instant response times during presentations.
